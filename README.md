# Greenhouse Church Pre-marriage Counseling

## Context

Jared Scholz, the pastor of Greenhouse Church, hopes to enable others to take point on discipling engaged couples leading up to their marriage. Sean Hatch, another pastor at Greenhouse Church, has sat in with Jared through two couples' counseling. But this is the first time Greenhouse has formalized the process to be used by other leaders at the church.

Hopefully this curriculum will evolve and get better every time it is used. So please consider this an invitation to provide feedback on this document.

## Takeaways

It will be great if the couple walks away with the following:

1. **Discovery** - Per the main goal above, the couple discovers new things about their partner
2. **Our Own Stories** - Folks naturally remember personal stories, and your life experience as leaders will stick with them. Try to tell a story from your marriage every week.
3. **An Elevated Value of Marriage** - The world desires oneness. We want to take this opportunity to show how marriage is the fullfillment of that desire.

## How To Succeed as a Mentor

**Get the couple to do the bulk of the talking**.  
These guidelines are conversation starters between the couple.

**Be a good listener**   
Use phrases like:

> "What I hear you saying is..."

or

> "What did you hear when they said...?"

## [The Premarital Commitment](commitment.md)

The world's currently holds a pretty low value on marriage. Similar to the counseling, the goal of the premarital commitment is to raise the value on marriage.

The desired process is that Jared will sit down and review the commitment with the couple and then pair them with a pre-marriage mentor.

From Jared's point of view, the couple has asked _him_ to officiate their wedding. Not a county clerk. Not their buddy on the internet. But _him_. That implies their appreciation of:

* Jared
* His stance on marriage
* His backing / approval / excitement / validation of the couple's marriage

The premarital commitment is an agreement to adhere to a standard of required behaviour that allows Jared to back / approve / get excited about / validate the marriage.

## [Curriculum](curriculum.md)

The main goal of the curriculum below is to lead the couple to talk about subjects that they would otherwise not talk about naturally. We want them to say "Wow! We never would have thought or talked about that until you brought it up!"

The following curriculum developed as a result of not being able to find one single great book. The curriculum is pulled from the best parts of the different books currently available. The hope is that they are the beginnings of good conversations. This should get the couple to a 7 out of 10 for the overall experience of pre-marriage counseling.

When the couple shows up and is dedicated to the process, they should be able to easily get to a 9 out of 10.
