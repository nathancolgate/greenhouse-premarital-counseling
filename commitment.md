# Pre-Maritall Commitment

Covenant marriage brings rights and responsibilities. The better prepared you are, the greater your potential is for a successful, life-long marriage. With this in mind, we ask that you agree to and sign the premarital commitment.

We commit to the following guidelines for three reasons.

1.  We love one another and want to set ourselves up for a successful marriage.
1.  We desire to be joined as one, specifically in a covenant Christian marriage.
1.  We honor our pastor and his conviction to participate in our wedding with his full confidence and blessing.

* We commit to fully participate in the process of premarital counseling. Showing up on time, being prepared, being honest, vulnerable, and invested. 
* We commit to live in accordance with God’s Word and His design for marriage, and will from this day forward, avoid sin by practicing sexual abstinence in every respect until after our wedding.
* We are convinced that God is deeply involved in covenant marriage. We are committed to obeying Jesus both individually and as a couple. We also seek to grow by praying together, plugging into a local church, and letting the Bible instruct us.
* We commit to seek the help and resources we may need over time, especially after our wedding! For the sake of our marriage and children, we will look to the Bible, and God’s people for help. We will not struggle in silence.

We understand that these statements reflect the weight and value of committing to a life-long covenant marriage, and that the marriage ceremony gives us the assurance that God blesses our commitment.
